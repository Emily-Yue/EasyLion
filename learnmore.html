        <a id="vegt">Vegetarianism</a><br>
        <p>
            According to the Vegetarian Society, a vegetarian is someone who does not eat any meat, poultry, game, fish, shellfish, or by-products of animal slaughter (1)

Vegetarian diets contain various levels of fruits, vegetables, grains, pulses, nuts, and seeds.

The inclusion of dairy, honey, and eggs depends on the type of diet you follow.

The most common types of vegetarians include:

Lacto-ovo vegetarians: vegetarians who avoid all animal flesh, but do consume dairy and egg products
Lacto vegetarians: vegetarians who avoid animal flesh and eggs, but do consume dairy products
Ovo vegetarians: vegetarians who avoid all animal products except eggs
Vegans: vegetarians who avoid all animal and animal-derived products
People who do not eat meat or poultry but do consume fish are considered pescatarians, whereas part-time vegetarians are often referred to as flexitarians.

Although they're sometimes considered vegetarians, pescatarians and flexitarians do eat animal flesh. So, they do not technically fall under the definition of vegetarianism.
        </p>
        <a id="vega">Veganism</a><br>
        <p>A vegan diet can be viewed as the strictest form of vegetarianism.

            Veganism is currently defined by the Vegan Society as a way of living that attempts to exclude all forms of animal exploitation and cruelty as much as possible (2).
            
            This includes exploitation for food and any other purpose.
            
            So, a vegan diet not only excludes animal flesh, but also dairy, eggs, and other ingredients that come from animals. These include:
            
            gelatin
            honey
            carmine
            pepsin
            shellac
            albumin
            whey
            casein
            some forms of vitamin D3
            Vegetarians and vegans often avoid eating animal products for similar reasons. The largest difference is the degree to which they consider animal products acceptable.
            
            For instance, both vegans and vegetarians may exclude meat from their diets for health or environmental reasons.
            
            Vegans also choose to avoid all animal by-products because they believe this has the largest impact on their health and the environment.
            
            In terms of ethics, vegetarians are opposed to killing animals for food, but generally consider it acceptable to consume animal by-products such as milk and eggs, as long as the animals are kept in adequate conditions.
            
            On the other hand, vegans believe that animals have a right to be free from human use, whether it's for food, clothing, science, or entertainment.
            
            As a result, they seek to avoid all animal by-products, regardless of the conditions in which animals are bred or housed.
            
            The desire to avoid all forms of animal exploitation is why vegans choose to forgo dairy and eggs — products that many vegetarians have no problem consuming.</p>
        <a id="all">Food Allergies</a><br>
        <p>The body's immune system keeps you healthy by fighting off infections and other dangers to good health. A food allergy reaction occurs when your immune system overreacts to a food or a substance in a food, identifying it as a danger and triggering a protective response.

            While allergies tend to run in families, it is impossible to predict whether a child will inherit a parent's food allergy or whether siblings will have a similar condition. Some research does suggest that the younger siblings of a child with a peanut allergy will also be allergic to peanuts.
            
            Symptoms of a food allergy can range from mild to severe. Just because an initial reaction causes few problems doesn't mean that all reactions will be similar; a food that triggered only mild symptoms on one occasion may cause more severe symptoms at another time.
            
            The most severe allergic reaction is anaphylaxis — a life-threatening whole-body allergic reaction that can impair your breathing, cause a dramatic drop in your blood pressure and affect your heart rate. Anaphylaxis can come on within minutes of exposure to the trigger food. It can be fatal and must be treated promptly with an injection of epinephrine (adrenaline).</p>

        <h4>Kosher</h4>
        <p>Kosher foods are divided into three main categories: meat/fowl, dairy and pareve. In order to keep kosher, meat/fowl and dairy must never be eaten together – and they must never come into contact with one another (for example, by sharing cooking utensils or serving plates).</p>
        <p>The following types of meat and meat products are not considered kosher: Meat from pigs, rabbits, squirrels, camels, kangaroos, or horses. Predator or scavenger birds, such as eagles, owls, gulls, and hawks. Cuts of beef that come from the hindquarters of the animal, such as flank, short loin, sirloin, round, and shank.</p>
        <h4>Jain Diet</h4>
        <p>The Jain cuisine is completely lacto-vegetarian and also excludes root and underground vegetables such as potato, garlic, onion etc., to prevent injuring small insects and microorganisms; and also to prevent the entire plant getting uprooted and killed. It is practised by Jain ascetics and lay Jains.</p><br>
